        <h2>Virat Kohili career path</h2>
        <pre style="background-color: blueviolet;">             Virat Kohli's senior career began when he made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services
             in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.
              On the international stage, he has been representing
              India since he was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka.</pre>

        <h4>Virat Kohili achievements</h4>
        <pre style="background-color: cornsilk;">           After the ODI World Cup heartbreak, the Indian team will start their bid for reclaiming the T20 World Cup later this year. In a run that stretches back to 2013, Indian men’s team has consistently performed well in the ICC events only to falter at the final hurdle.

            India haven’t won a global ICC in a decade now despite stars including the likes of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Jasprit Bumrah.
            
            India legend Harbhajan Singh feels that the ongoing year will mark the beginning of a new chapter in Kohli’s illustrious career</pre>
